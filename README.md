# Data Visualization Techniques - PAC 2

This repository contains three different data visualizations created for the PAC 2 of the Data Visualization subject, as part of the Master's in Data Science. The visualizations showcase the use of **Line Chart**, **Arc Diagram**, and **OHLC Chart** to analyze different datasets.

## Visualizations

1. **Line Chart**: 
   - **Title**: Cumulative COVID-19 Incidence in the USA, India, Germany, and Brazil
   - **Description**: This line chart shows the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the USA, India, Germany, and Brazil over time. The goal is to compare the evolution of the pandemic in these countries, highlighting the influence of multiple COVID variants on the course of the pandemic.

2. **Arc Diagram**:
   - **Title**: IMDb's Most Featured Actors: Collaboration Network
   - **Description**: This arc diagram represents the collaboration network of the most featured actors on IMDb. It illustrates the relationships between actors based on the number of films in which they have appeared together. The code for this diagram was adapted from [D3 Graph Gallery - Arc Diagram](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/arc_template.html).

3. **OHLC Chart**:
   - **Title**: Tesla Stock Price 2024 - 2025 (OHLC)
   - **Description**: The OHLC chart visualizes Tesla's stock price data for the years 2024 and 2025. It shows the opening, high, low, and closing prices of the stock, helping to identify patterns and fluctuations in the market.
